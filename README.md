# Tsumego
This is a Kodi addon that allows one to solve tsumego


# TODO
* get a random problem taking rating into account

# Ideas that weren't done
* scale the board when the tsumego is small - won't do now, as it doesn't seem to be a problem
* show a tree of all variations - probably won't do, because it would be too slow
