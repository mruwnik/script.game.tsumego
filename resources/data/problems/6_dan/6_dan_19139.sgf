When Black plays 2, White jumps to 3 and in response to Black 4, White plays a hane at 5. This is not a ko; Black is dead.   I hope you can appreciate the role White 1 is playing in this position.RIGHT])

(;B[rq];W[rs]LB[rp:1]LB[rq:2]LB[rs:3]C[White's descent at 1 is probably the ordinary approach. If Black responds to this by blocking at 2, then White's placement at 3kills him.  Black 2 is unimaginative. Now both sides have made a mistake.CHOICE]))

In addition to what we've covered thus far, White could play 1 at 'a', but when Black blocks at 'b' and White connects at 'c', Black can live by playing 2, so this is obviously a failure for White.CHOICE]))
