It is sub-optimal, but the reasons why are subtle. In this case, there are two reasons. First, should the outside white stones get involved in a capturing race so that white needs to capture black's corner, black can capture at D, forcing white E, increasing black's liberties and creating a ko mouth, which means potential for trouble. Second, black F becomes a threat to bridge under with a ko. Without the A and B exchange, there is no potential for black F to be a sente move.RIGHT]LB[sq:A]LB[sr:B]LB[ps:C]LB[sp:D]LB[ro:E]LB[rn:F])
