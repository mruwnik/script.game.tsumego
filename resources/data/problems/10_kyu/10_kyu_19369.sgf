(;B[gs];W[fs];B[er]C[Solution 1. The hane kills  -  The single white hane at 1 does the job.  That the position resulting from White'sblock at 2 is a dead shape is simply part ofthe body of common knowledge of life and death.RIGHT]LB[gs:1]LB[fs:2]LB[er:3])

A separate technique  -  In the beginning Black can also make the placement at 1 and, when White blocks at 2, play 3 to kill the white group. If White attaches with 2 at A, Black plays at 2 and answers White B at C.  Rather than using such a complicated method, however, killing with the hane keeps things much simplerRIGHT])
