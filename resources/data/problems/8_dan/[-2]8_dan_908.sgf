C[White has foolishly ignored the marked ko threat in favor of saving her group 
up top.  Make some noise black.

C[Playing the 3-3 invasion will get you sealed in, and the marked stone will be 
left stranded.  It also does not take advantage of the ko threat that was played
 at a.  You can do better.
